# Minecraft Font Setup

## Download Instructions

To get the exact Minecraft font, you need to:

1. **Download the Minecraft font file** from one of these sources:
   - Official Minecraft font: "Minecrafter" or "MinecraftRegular"
   - Alternative: Search for "Minecraft.ttf" from font repositories
   - Popular option: "Minecrafter Regular" from dafont.com

2. **Rename the font file** to `Minecraft.ttf`

3. **Place the file** in this directory: `/assets/fonts/Minecraft.ttf`

## Legal Note
Make sure you have the right to use the font in your application. Some Minecraft fonts are fan-made recreations that are free to use.

## Popular Minecraft-style Fonts
- **Minecrafter**: Most accurate recreation
- **MinecraftRegular**: Another good option
- **Minecraft Evenings**: Stylized version

## After Adding the Font
Once you place `Minecraft.ttf` in this directory, restart your Expo development server for the font to be loaded.
