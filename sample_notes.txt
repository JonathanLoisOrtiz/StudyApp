Sample Study Notes - Organic Chemistry

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy. The process occurs in two main stages: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle.

The mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell because they produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through cellular respiration.

Osmosis is the movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration.

Active transport is a process that requires energy to move substances against their concentration gradient. This process uses ATP as its energy source.

The periodic table organizes elements by their atomic number, which represents the number of protons in an atom's nucleus.

Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons, while ionic bonds form when electrons are transferred from one atom to another.

The pH scale measures the acidity or basicity of a solution. A pH of 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is basic.

Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur.

DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and contains the genetic instructions for the development and function of all living things.

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
